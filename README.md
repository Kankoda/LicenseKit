## About LicenseKit

LicenseKit helps you protect your software with commercial licenses on all major Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS).

LicenseKit lets you define licenses with code that is compiled into the product binary, read licenses from files, validate licenses from remote APIs, integrate with external services like Gumroad, etc.

LicenseKit licenses can specify and validate expiration date, platform, bundle ID, tier, environment, features, and much, much more.

LicenseKit lets you cache validation results to handle temporary connectivity loss, and use service proxying to use multiple services to validate license keys. 



## Pricing

LicenseKit requires a commercial license to be used. It's free to start using and affordable to scale.

You can purchase a license from the [LicenseKit website][Website] or use `FREE` as license key to use the library with a limited number of code- and file-based licenses and features.



## Installation

LicenseKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/LicenseKit/LicenseKit.git
```

LicenseKit only has to be added to the main app target. If you are using LicenseKit with a library, make sure to set up your Swift package so that your users get both your library and LicenseKit when fetching your package.



## Getting started

The [online documentation][Documentation] has a [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] that helps you get started with LicenseKit.

In LicenseKit, a ``LicenseEngine`` is used to manage your product licenses. Use *your* LicenseKit license key to create a ``LicenseEngine``, then define which license service to use.

Here, we use the "FREE" LicenseKit license key to create an license engine that uses a `.binary` service with hard-coded licenses:

```swift
let engine = try await LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "Your license key") {
    .binary(
        licenses: [
            License(licenseKey: "license-key-1"),
            License(licenseKey: "license-key-2")
        ]
    )
}
```

The engine will use the service you specified to get the license, and will by default validate the license for the current platform, product bundle and date before returning it. You can perform more validations after retrieving the license.

You can choose from many different service types, such as `.binary`, `.file`, `.api`, `.gumroad`, `.cached`, and `.proxy` to create a service configuration that suits your needs.  

For more information, please see the [online documentation][Documentation] and the [getting started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library.



## Demo Application

The demo app lets you try out the library on iOS and macOS. Just open and run the `Demo` project.
