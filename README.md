# LicenseKit

LicenseKit helps you protect your software with commercial licenses on all major Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS).

LicenseKit [licenses][Licenses] can specify and validate expiration date, platform, bundle ID, tier, environment, features, and much, much more.

LicenseKit has different [services][License-Services] that can validate code-based licenses, read licenses from files, validate licenses from remote APIs, integrate with services like Gumroad, etc.

LicenseKit lets you cache validation results to handle temporary connectivity loss, and use service proxying to use multiple services to validate license keys. 



## Installation

LicenseKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/Kankoda/LicenseKit.git
```

LicenseKit only has to be linked to the main target. If you use LicenseKit with a library, make sure to set up your Swift package so that your users get both your library and LicenseKit when fetching your package.



## Features

LicenseKit provides a bunch of license-specific features:

* ‚úÖ [License Validation][Licenses] - LicenseKit can validate licenses in many ways.
* ‚å®Ô∏è [Binary Licenses][License-Services] - LicenseKit lets you define licenses with source code.
* üìÑ [File-Based Licenses][License-Services] - LicenseKit lets you define licenses with plain text files.
* üå©Ô∏è [API/Cloud-Based Licenses][License-Services] - LicenseKit can validate licenses with web requests.
* üí∞ [Gumroad][License-Services] - LicenseKit can integrate directly with Gumroad.
* üì¶ [License Caching][License-Services] - LicenseKit can cache successful license validations.
* ‚û°Ô∏è [Service Proxying][License-Services] - LicenseKit can chain multiple services together.



## Getting started

In LicenseKit, a `LicenseEngine` is used to manage your product licenses, with one or several validation services. 

Use *your* LicenseKit license key to create a ``LicenseEngine``, then define which license service to use.

Here, we use the "FREE" license key to create an engine that uses a `.binary` service with two hard-coded licenses:

```swift
let engine = try await LicenseEngine(licenseKey: "FREE") {
    .binary(
        licenses: [
            License(licenseKey: "license-key-1"),
            License(licenseKey: "license-key-2")
        ]
    )
}
```

You can choose from many different service types, such as `.binary`, `.file`, `.api`, `.gumroad`, `.cached`, and `.proxy` to create a service configuration that suits your needs.

See the [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] for more information.



## Pricing

LicenseKit requires a commercial license to be used. It's free to start using and affordable to scale.

You can purchase a license or try out the free, unlimited trial from the [LicenseKit website][Website].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library.



## Demo Application

The demo app lets you try out the library on iOS and macOS. Just open and run the `Demo` project.
