# LicenseKit

LicenseKit is a Swift library that lets you protect your apps and SDKs with commercial licenses on major Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS & visionOS).

LicenseKit can define licenses with code, generate encrypted license files, read licenses from plain CSV files, integrate with any REST API, etc. It also has pre-defined Gumroad integrations in place. 

LicenseKit can validate expiration date, platform, bundle ID, tier, environment, features, and much more. It lets you cache licenses to handle temporary connectivity loss, and combine multiple data sources for flexible validation.



## Pricing

LicenseKit requires a commercial license to be used. It's free to start using, and affordable to scale. You can sign up for a license or try out a free, unlimited trial from the [LicenseKit website][Website].



## Installation

LicenseKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/Kankoda/LicenseKit.git
```

LicenseKit only has to be linked to the main target. If you use LicenseKit with a Swift package, make sure to set up your package as described in the [online documentation][Documentation].



## Getting started

With LicenseKit, your app/library should create a ``LicenseEngine`` with the license key you obtain when you [sign up for LicenseKit][Website], then define which service type you want to use to use to fetch customer licenses.

For instance, this would create an engine with two licenses that are compiled into the product validated on-device:

```swift
let licenseEngine = try await LicenseEngine(
    licenseKey: "your-license-key",
    licenseStore: .myInternalLicenseStore // optional
    licenseService: { 
        .binary(
            licenses: [
                License(licenseKey: "license-key-1", ...),
                License(licenseKey: "license-key-2", ...)
            ]
        )
    }
)
```

There are many service types to choose from, as described in the [license services article][Services]. You can define licenses with source code, read licenses from file, fetch licenses from an API, integrate with services like Gumroad, etc.

Once you have a license engine instance, you can use it to resolve and validate licenses for your product, by letting your customers enter *their* license key. See the [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] for more information.
