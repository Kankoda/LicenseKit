## About LicenseKit

LicenseKit helps you protect your closed-source `Swift` libraries behind a commercial license.

With LicenseKit, you can require a license key before developers can start using your libraries.

LicenseKit supports standard and custom license models. This means that a LicenseKit license can specify things like expiration date, valid bundle IDs etc. but also domain-specific features.



## Platform Support

LicenseKit supports the following platforms:

* iOS 13.0
* macOS 11.0
* tvOS 13.0
* watchOS 6.0

This means that you can distribute your closed-source licensed to all major Apple platforms.



## Installation

The best way to install LicenseKit is with the Swift Package Manager.

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/LicenseKit.git
```

LicenseKit must also be added to any application that uses your library.



## Getting started

Once LicenseKit is added to your project, you need to obtain a license before you can start using it.

## Documentation

The LicenseKit documentation contains extensive information, code examples etc. and makes it easy to overview the various parts of the library.

You can either [download][Documentation] the documentation or build it directly in Xcode, using `Product/Build Documentation`.
