## About LicenseKit

LicenseKit helps you protect your Swift-based apps and libraries with a commercial license. With LicenseKit, you can require that users register a valid license key before they can start using your products or certain features within. 

LicenseKit lets you specify expiration date, supported platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS), bundle IDs, tier etc. for each license and validate the current license whenever you want.

LicenseKit requires a commercial license. You can obtain a license from the [LicenseKit website][Licenses].



## Platform Support

LicenseKit supports the following platforms:

* iOS 13.0
* macOS 11.0
* tvOS 13.0
* watchOS 6.0

This means that you can use LicenseKit to protect your software on all major Apple platforms.



## Installation

The best way to install LicenseKit is with the Swift Package Manager.

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/LicenseKit.git
```

If you are building an app, LicenseKit only has to be added to the app target. If you are building a library, make sure to setup SPM so that your users adds both your library and LicenseKit.



## Getting started

Once LicenseKit is added to your project, you need to obtain a license before you can start using it.
