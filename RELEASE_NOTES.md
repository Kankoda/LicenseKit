# Release Notes

LicenseKit honors semantic versioning to great extent:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes *can* still occur in minor versions and patches, if the alternative is to not be able to release important new features or fixes.
