# Release Notes

LicenseKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can occur in minor versions and patches, if
the alternative is to not be able to release new features or
fixes that are critical or provide important value.

These release notes only include functional changes. They do
not cover license changes, which means that there may be new
versions that are not listed here.
